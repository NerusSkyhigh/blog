<div style="text-align: justify">
I’m a PhD student in Physics at the University of Trento (Statistical and Biological Physics group) with a strong passion for computer science. This passion led me to choose a computational path both for my curricular and extracurricular classes during my bachelor's and Master's degrees and to work on personal projects in my free time. I’m also one of the founding members of Progetto Apollo, a scientific divulgation group operating at the University of Trento in collaboration with Arditodesìo. Since 2019 I’ve been a tutor for the University of Trento. My hobbies include video games and parkour.</div>

### Work Experience

#### Classroom Tutor <i class="bi bi-person-workspace"></i>
<div style="text-align: justify">
In the in-class courses, my task as a tutor was to prepare ad-hoc exercises beforehand and then follow the students in their reasoning by providing hints and guidance toward the solution. In the laboratory courses, our job was to explain the lab experiences to the students and assist them in the data collection and analysis ensuring that they understood the underlying reasoning and scientific approach.

#### Additional Info
**Institution**: _University of Trento_ (Italy)

I was assigned to the following courses:

- _Sep 2022-Dec 2022_: Introductory Physics Laboratory (DII), [Mathematical Basis for Cognitive Sciences]{.underline} (CIMEC), Mathematics and Statistics I (CIBIO);  
- _Mar 2022-June 2022_: Laboratory of Physics I with Matlab (DF), Introductory Physics Laboratory (DICAM);  
- _Sep 2021-Dec 2021_: Introductory Physics Laboratory (DII);  
- _Sep 2020-Dec 2020_: Mathematics and Statistics (A3C);  
- _Sep 2019-Jan 2020_: Calculus I (DICAM), [Calculus I]{.underline} (DIPSCO), [Quantitative Methods for life-sciences]{.underline} (DIPSCO).

The underlined courses represent the courses for which I was the only tutor. In all other courses, I was part
of a team of 2 to 4 tutors.

#### Storyteller / Science Communicator <i class="bi bi-pen"></i>
<div style="text-align: justify">
I'm one of the founding members of Progetto Apollo, a scientific divulgation group operating at the University of Trento in collaboration with Arditodesìo. Some of our activities include research on a key topic or an interview with a Professor at the University of Trento to write narratives with the principles of storytelling.

The plays were then performed in the course of various editions of Teatro della Meraviglia, EIT RAW Materials 2021, CO.SCIENZA Festival 2019, Focus Days 2019 and Fisicittà 2017. In 2022 we partnered with Caltech for the event “La Terra fatta dagli umani” (Earth made by humans) about the beginning of the Anthropocene. The resulting performances were presented both in Trento and at Caltech.
